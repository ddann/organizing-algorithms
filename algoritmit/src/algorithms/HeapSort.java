/**
 * Heapsort is a in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm.
 * It is one of the most efficient (simple) algorithms for sorting, but somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a
 * well-implemented quicksort, thought it has the advantage of a more favorable worst-case O(n log n) runtime. 
 * Because of this it is usually used for big data inputs for efficiency and security as well as because for being an in-place
 * algorithm in embedded systems with real-time constraints or systems concerned with security.
 * 
 * 
 * Shortly it works as follows;
 * It divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region
 * by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region. The heap data structure improves its efficiency.
 * 
 * And step by step:
 * It can be divided into two parts:
 * WIKIPEDIA KOPIOO PITKÃ„LTI!:
 * In the first step, a heap is built out of the data. The heap is placed in an array with the layout of a complete binary tree.
 * The complete binary tree maps the binary tree structure into the array indices; each array index represents a node; the index of the
 * node's parent, left child branch, or right child branch are simple expressions. The root node is stored at index 0;
 * i is here the index of the current node:
 *   iParent     = floor((i-1) / 2)
 *   iLeftChild  = 2*i + 1
 *   iRightChild = 2*i + 2
 * In the second step, a sorted array is created by repeatedly removing the largest element from the heap (the root of the heap), and inserting it
 * into the final sorted array to be returned. The heap is updated after each removal to maintain the heap correct.
 * Once all objects have been removed from the heap, the array to be returned is sorted.
